## Final Project, Part 1: Pitch
> Test and validate 2-3 initial ideas.

In the field of data science, projects are practical. One of the best ways to quickly test ideas is to share your ideas with others 
and get feedback. Start by reviewing the requirements and [suggested data sets](./datasets.md), then generate a list of 2-3 potential 
ideas you'd like to pursue. 

**Requirements**
1. Generate 2-3 different possible problem statements (of at least 250 words each).
    - State the questions you seek to answer, data set suggestions, and possible challenges.
2. Create a written pitch for each possibility that can be shared with your instructor and classmates.

Problem Statement #1: Instacart Orders
> Instacart is part of the 'Uber' phenomenon where individuals act as contractors to fulfill grocery shopping tasks. By learning more
about user behavior and buying trends among different types of items and the frequency at which they are ordered, Instacart can not only
develop new products to increase business but also to help the consumer find what they need faster. They can create quick buttons for
frequent shoppers (much like Amazon) and they can develop an algorithmic way to deliver related items to frequently purchased items to
to help increase purchases.
    > Questions: Which types of products are purchased the most frequently?
                 Which exact products are purchased most frequently?
    > Challenges: It is a very large data set and will likely need to be scaled down. Also, because the data sets are all in separate csv
    files, I will have to do a lot of clean up to get the data in a format that makes sense.
    > Pitch: Using the Instacart open source data and machine learning algorithms,
    I will analyze the frequency at which types of products and specific products are purchased over a years time and across 200,000
    Instacart users. By doing this, I hope to discover which products are purchased the most often and then use my findings to develop
    new products or algorithms to improve the Instacart shopping experience for their users.

Problem Statement #2: Amazon Pricing Data
> Millions of people shop on Amazon everyday. Amazon claims to feature competitive pricing and be a good place for vendors to sell their
products. Amazon's pricing is completely algorithmic and can fluctuate on a day to day, vendor to vendor basis. By examining Amazon's
pricing algorithm and identifying a correlation between vendor and price, we may be able to help vendors decide if Amazon is the right
platform to sell their products based on the competition there inherintly is with Amazon Fulfillment Services.
    > Questions: Is Amazon's pricing algorithm produce fair pricing across vendors who fulfill them?
                 How does the vendor affect pricing?
    > Challenges: There isn't a data dictionary to define the data points in this data set. I do not have access to revenue just the pricing
    data for the products. This won't deliver a clear and definitive answer to my problem but learning how the pricing algorithm operates
    between vendors can help inform business decisions for smaller companies who look to sell on Amazon.
    > Pitch: Using the Amazon Pricing data and machine learning algorithms, I will analyze the relationship between Amazon's pricing
    and the vendor selling and shipping the product being sold. By doing this, I hope to discover whether a vendor selling their products
    on Amazon are getting priced higher than Amazon fulfilling the order themselves and thus possibly build an argument that Amazon is
    not the best place for outside vendors to sell their products.
