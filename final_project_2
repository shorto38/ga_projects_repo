Problem Statement #1: Instacart Orders
> Instacart is part of the 'Uber' phenomenon where individuals act as contractors to fulfill grocery shopping tasks. By learning more
about user behavior and buying trends among different types of items and the frequency at which they are ordered, Instacart can not only
develop new products to increase business but also to help the consumer find what they need faster. They can create quick buttons for
frequent shoppers (much like Amazon) and they can develop an algorithmic way to deliver related items to frequently purchased items to
to help increase purchases.
    > Questions: Which types of products are purchased the most frequently?
                 Which exact products are purchased most frequently?
    > Challenges: It is a very large data set and will likely need to be scaled down. Also, because the data sets are all in separate csv
    files, I will have to do a lot of clean up to get the data in a format that makes sense.
    > Pitch: Using the Instacart open source data and machine learning algorithms,
    I will analyze the frequency at which types of products and specific products are purchased over a years time and across 200,000
    Instacart users. By doing this, I hope to discover which products are purchased the most often and then use my findings to develop
    new products or algorithms to improve the Instacart shopping experience for their users.
    
    reframed in terms of a `target variable`. In our case, `times product is purchased` could be our `y`,
    and we can spend time determining which features (`X`) help us predict that value.
